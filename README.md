# PoliBench

---

PoliScore and PoliBench are **🚨WORKS IN PROGRESS🚨**. Much of what you may read around here should be interpreted as **ASPIRATIONAL WORK**, not necessarily representative of what is published on poliscore.us.

---

PoliBench is a lightweight benchmark suite for evaluating whether AI systems can reason accurately and responsibly about public policy. It is the companion project to **PoliScore**, a framework for assessing the structural quality of legislation using clear, non-partisan principles.

PoliBench provides small, focused test cases that check whether a model can:

- identify policy problems and causal mechanisms
- evaluate the strength of evidence
- assess implementation feasibility
- reason about economic sustainability
- identify distributional impacts
- detect governance risks
- anticipate unintended consequences

These correspond directly to the **seven pillars** of the PoliScore Framework.

---

## Purpose

PoliBench is intended for:

- developers evaluating AI policy-reasoning abilities
- researchers studying policy analysis and governance
- anyone comparing how different models reason about legislation

It is not designed to measure political ideology or take normative positions.  
It measures **reasoning quality**, not political alignment.

---

## Usage

The benchmark consists of small, self-contained example tasks.  
Each task includes:

- a short policy scenario or bill snippet
- one or more questions
- an expected answer or evaluation criteria

You can use these tasks to:

- test a model interactively
- compare outputs across models
- evaluate consistency and reasoning depth

More formal tooling may be added in future versions.

## Project Status

PoliBench is in an early, open-development phase.  
New tasks and suites will be added gradually as the PoliScore ecosystem evolves.
